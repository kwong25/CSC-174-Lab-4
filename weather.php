			<p>People say we're lucky because it's a "dry heat" and it doesn't snow here. I say it's a season-less oven that occasionally turns off in the "winter". Summer lasts about 8 months and we don't have those nifty cool summer nights other places do. This year, we had our first 100 degree day on May 21st, which is abnormally late in the year. In 2020 the first 100 (though technically it was 102) degree day was April 26th. In the year 2020, Phoenix broke it's 1989 record for most days at or above 100 degrees with a whopping 144 days of just being an oven.</p>

			<p>People joke about being able to fry an egg on the sidewalk. Having tried it, I wouldn't recommend it because the eggs cook really slow and get dry and rubbery and weird. But yes, you could cook an egg on the sidewalk if you <em>really</em> wanted to. A better idea for taking advantage of The Oven that is the outdoors is using your car to bake cookies. Leave some dough on a plate in the car in the morning and come back after work or school to some nice gooey cookies and a fantastic smelling car.</p>
