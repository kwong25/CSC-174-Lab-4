            <p>Since it's ya know... a <em>desert</em>, it doesn't really rain here. In fact, in 2021, it has rained less than an inch in many parts of Phoenix. Phoenix is considered by the National Weather Service to be in an "Extreme Drought", but at least we're not in an "Exceptional Drought" I guess? While we don't usually have water shortages and rationing like California does, the future doesn't look so good. A vast system of irrigation canals branching from the Salt, Gila, and Colorado Rivers have supplied the city with water for decades. The current Salt River pictured above doesn't look like it'll be supplying too much water now.</p>

            <p>Somehow though, in the deserts of Phoenix people somehow think it's a fantastic idea to have a lot of sprawling golf courses, country clubs, green lawns, and So. Many. Pools. Billionaires want to build picturesque suburbs just outside Phoenix with pretty green lawns and parks and lakes. Where they think all that water would be coming from continues to confuse me.</p>
